**Answer:**

Linear regression is used for finding **linear relationship** between target and one or more predictors. In the most simplest form, we are finding the relationship between two continuous variables. One is **predictor(independent)** variable and other is **response(dependent)** variable. The equation below is a simple representation.

$Y = B + AX$

where Y is the predicted value, B is the bias, A is a weight, and  is the _independent_ variable.

There are three basic steps to follow:
- Clean the data
- Split the data to train and test
- Create the Linear Regression Model
- Fit in the training data
- Use the test data to calculate the accuracy
- and voila
