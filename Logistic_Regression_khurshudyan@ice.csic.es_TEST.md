**Answer:**

To predict which class a data belongs, a threshold can be set. Based upon this threshold, the obtained estimated probability is classified into classes.
Say, if predicted_value â‰¥ 0.5, then classify email as spam else as not spam.
Decision boundary can be linear or non-linear. Polynomial order can be increased to get complex decision boundary.
